# MedLab-Diagnostics
## Project Overview

This project analyzes patient and test data from MedLab Diagnostics, a biomedical lab in Kumasi, to uncover trends in test demand, patient return patterns, and lab operational efficiency. Using Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for interactive dashboarding, we visualized key insights to help the lab improve customer retention, optimize scheduling, and boost revenue. The project was completed collaboratively by a team of three as part of a hands-on data analytics training program.
### Tools used:
- Excel for data cleaning, exploration and manipulation
- Power BI for visualization

## Visuals and Their Representation

1. Line Chart – Monthly Patient Visits
Tracks the number of patients visiting the lab each month to uncover seasonal trends or drop-offs.

2. Clustered Column Chart
Displays the count of new and returning patients during peak and off-peak hours to identify when different patient types are most likely to visit.
   
4. Bar Chart – Revenue by Test Category
Displays total revenue generated per test category to identify the lab’s most profitable services.

5. Column Chart – Test Demand
Shows the number of times each test was requested, highlighting high-demand versus underutilized tests.

## Source of Data

The dataset was provided to my team and me by our instructors during our data analytics training program as part of a hands-on group project.

## Key Questions Addressed

1. How can data help improve customer retention at MedLab Diagnostics?
- By identifying patterns in patient visits (new vs. returning) and analyzing peak/off-peak attendance to enhance service delivery and patient satisfaction.

2. What are the most and least demanded diagnostic tests?
- To inform inventory planning, resource allocation, and targeted marketing for underutilized services.

3. How can workflow be optimized based on patient traffic patterns?
- By evaluating patient flow during peak and off-peak hours to adjust staffing and scheduling accordingly.

4. Which test categories generate the most revenue?
- To prioritize high-revenue services and explore growth opportunities in underperforming areas.

## Key Insights

1. High-Demand Tests:
- Cholesterol, Malaria, Full Blood Count, Pregnancy, and Liver Function tests were the most frequently requested, indicating high public health relevance and revenue potential.

2. Underutilized Tests:
- ECG and H. Pylori tests were significantly under-requested, suggesting a gap in awareness, accessibility, or promotion.

3. Patient Retention Patterns:
- The majority of patients were one-time visitors, with returning patients making up a smaller but consistent portion of overall visits.

4. Peak vs. Off-Peak Hours:
- Returning patients tended to visit during peak hours, while new patients were more likely to visit during off-peak hours — highlighting different engagement behaviors.

5. Monthly Visit Trends:
- Patient visits dropped noticeably in April and October, possibly due to seasonal factors such as holidays, weather, or economic cycles.

6. Revenue Distribution:
- Revenue was concentrated around a few high-demand tests, indicating an opportunity to diversify income by promoting underutilized but essential diagnostics.

## Recommendations

1. Promote Underutilized Tests:
- Launch awareness campaigns and health education to encourage uptake of important but underused tests like ECG and H. Pylori.

2. Bundle Diagnostic Services:
- Offer packages that combine high-demand tests with less popular ones to boost overall service utilization and preventive care.

3. Optimize Staff Scheduling:
- Align staff shifts and resources with patient traffic patterns to reduce wait times during peak hours and better utilize off-peak periods.

4. Enhance Patient Engagement:
- Implement follow-up systems, loyalty programs, or reminders to encourage one-time patients to return for routine checkups or additional services.

5. Leverage Seasonal Trends:
- Prepare targeted promotions or mobile outreach during low-traffic months (e.g., April, October) to maintain steady patient flow year-round.

6. Focus on High-Revenue Tests:
- Prioritize and further market tests that drive the most revenue while identifying potential to grow income through expanded offerings.
